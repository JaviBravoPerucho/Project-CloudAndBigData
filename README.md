## Description of the problem
Analyze and rank the greatest basketball shooters in the NBA (National Basketball Association) throughout history.

## Need for Big Data processing and Cloud Computing.
I need to collect a lot of data about NBA players and seasons to determine who were the best at shooting. This includes 3-point shooting, mid-range shooting and free throws.
The main stats that I'm going to use to determine the greatness of a player's shooting ability are Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%), Three-point Percentage (3P%)
and Free-Throw Percentage (FT%).

## Description of the data: Where does it come from? How was it acquired? What does it mean? What format is it? How big is it (1 GB minimum)?
## Description of the application, programming model(s), platform and infrastructure.
## Software design (architectural design, code baseline, dependencies…)
## Usage (including screenshots that demonstrate how it works).
## Performance evaluation (speed-up) on the Cloud and discussion about identified overheads and optimizations done.
## Advanced features, like tools/models/platforms not explained in class, advanced functions, techniques to mitigate overheads, challenging implementation aspects...
## Conclusions, including goals achieved, improvements suggested, lessons learnt, future work, interesting insights…
## References.
